Angular 2 test

Based on the tutorial from: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/
Re-naming components and to fit the BigFuzz project

Got to the end of https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt5.html
but there is no example of using the http service. Had a go, but got into dependeny injection hell.
Googling reports various ways of using the http service, depending on angular2 version. This is WIP 
even if Angular2 is now Beta.

On Ubuntu, run:

echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p


For the lite-server to work (got errors wrt watches)
